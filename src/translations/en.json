Especially children from disadvantaged families who lack even basic necessities - not to mention warmth.",
      "paragraph4": "And then a personal story happened in my life. A very important one. Perhaps I'll share it later. But it was this experience that became the moment when everything fell into place. That's when CrossCharity was born.",
      "paragraph5": "For the first two and a half years, the foundation worked quietly. Without a website, without social media pages, without publicity. Only with my personal funds, friendly partnerships, and support from friends who believed, trusted, and helped with whatever they could.",
      "paragraph6": "Now the foundation has more than 40 people. This is not just a team - these are people who live this cause every day. CrossCharity was never about image or profit. It's about pain. About responsibility. About a deep understanding that a catastrophe can happen in children's lives - and no one but us can be there for them.",
      "paragraph7": "We act quietly. But seriously. And always - with love."

It's about being there for others."
