# 🛠️ Ultra-Strict Fixes & Multilingual Rule

## Description:
This rule enforces a zero-tolerance policy for incorrect edits, auto-changes, or template behavior.  
All modifications must be done **EXACTLY** as instructed.  
Supports **multilingual sites (Spanish, Ukrainian, English, Hebrew)** and must never skip a language or mis-translate.

## Globs:
**  # Applies to all files in the project

---

## 🔒 FIXING RULES

1. **Only Edit What Is Ordered**:
   - AI is **strictly forbidden** from editing text, files, styles, components, blocks, layout, or content **unless specifically instructed**.
   - No “smart changes”, no “I think this is better”. If it’s not in the prompt — **DO NOT TOUCH IT**.

2. **Exact Edits**:
   - If user says "change text", only the specified **text** changes.
   - If user says "change color", only the specified **color** changes.
   - If user says "delete section", only that section must be removed — **not neighboring code**.

3. **No Overwriting Other Logic**:
   - All existing logic must be **preserved** unless ordered otherwise.
   - Cursor must **respect all functional, UI and business logic** in the file.

## 🌍 MULTILINGUAL ENFORCEMENT

4. **Languages Supported**:
   - The project is multilingual: **Spanish, Ukrainian, English, Hebrew**.
   - Cursor must **always detect language files** or logic and update **all four** correctly.

5. **Translation Rules**:
   - If editing a label, it must be updated **in all four languages**, in their proper files or translation JSONs.
   - **Do not translate manually** unless asked — use consistent, correct translations only.
   - **NEVER remove** any language key. **NEVER add extra languages** without permission.

6. **Structure Respect**:
   - Follow the exact format of `i18n`, `locales`, or any translation structure used (e.g., `en.json`, `es.json`, etc.).
   - Do not mix languages. Do not invent values. Do not misalign keys.

## 💣 DANGER ZONE — AUTO-BLOCK

7. **Forbidden Actions (Hard Rules)**:
   - ❌ NO self-decided rewrites
   - ❌ NO editing unrelated code
   - ❌ NO changing structure unless instructed
   - ❌ NO removing or renaming things unless asked
   - ❌ NO styling guesses ("maybe better with blue") — **NEVER**

8. **If Unclear — ASK**:
   - If the AI is not 100% sure what to do — **STOP and ask**.
   - Better to clarify than break structure or logic.

---

## ✅ Style & Precision

9. **Precision Over Speed**:
   - Every change must be **clear, minimal, exact, and correctly placed**.
   - AI must test edits logically — no broken or partial output.

10. **Respect User’s Commands**:
   - If the user says:  
     > "Change this block text and update colors, and don’t touch layout."  
     Cursor must:
     - Change **only the text**
     - Change **only the mentioned colors**
     - Leave layout and spacing **exactly as is**

## 💎 Final Reminder:

Cursor is acting as **an elite developer under strict QA** — no auto-fixes, no initiative, no assumptions.  
**Only do what the client says. Do it fully. Do it perfectly. Do it across all supported languages.**
